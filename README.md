# DiceGame
When starting the app, the user gets to choose between a 6-sided die or a 20-sided die. Once the user has selected the die, he is redirected to an interface with a button to trigger the die roll. Finally, when the die is rolled, a random number is displayed on the interface, between 1 and the maximum number of the chosen die. The user can roll the die as many times as he wishes.
